- **Gamification Strategy:** A systematic approach that applies elements of game playing (such as point scoring, competition, and rules of play) to other areas of activity, typically to encourage engagement with a product or service. In the context of runner performance improvement, it involves incorporating game-like incentives to enhance motivation and productivity among runners.
- **Rewards:** Incentives provided to runners as a recognition of their accomplishments or performance. These can be tangible (like bonuses or gifts) or intangible (like public recognition). Rewards are central to a gamification strategy as they serve to motivate runners to reach specific performance targets.
- **Achievement Rewards:** Specific rewards that are granted when runners reach particular milestones or complete significant tasks. These rewards are usually tied to specific achievements and are part of the motivational structure of the gamification strategy, encouraging continued participation and effort.
- **Benefits:** Advantages or perks provided to runners, which can be either direct or indirect. In a gamification context, benefits are often enhanced or unlocked based on the runner's game-like engagement and achievements.
- **Special Status Benefits:** Exclusive advantages or perks that are granted to runners who reach certain levels of achievement within the gamification system. These benefits can include access to elite groups, special recognition, or additional authority within the organizational hierarchy. They are designed to provide visible markers of success and status within the company.
- **Progress Tracking:** A gamification element that involves monitoring and displaying an individual’s progress towards achieving set goals. This typically includes visual representations such as progress bars or dashboards, which help motivate runners by clearly showing how close they are to earning rewards or achieving a new status.
- **Experience Points (XPs):** A common gamification technique where individuals earn points for completing tasks or achieving goals. These points accumulate over time and can be used to track progress, unlock levels, or gain rewards. In a workplace setting, XPs serve as a quantifiable measure of an runner’s contributions and performance.
